          Nature’s Window, WA <br />Mother Nature knows what makes a good photo,
          so much so that she has perfectly framed a view of Kalbarri National
          Park with this sandstone structure. It’s easy to access these
          seemingly precarious stacks of sandstone via a one-kilometre return
          walk from a sealed lookout.

          Remarkable Rocks, SA <br />These craggy granite forms dominate the
          landscape in this section of Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo
          Island. Much of their surface is covered in pumpkin-coloured lichen;
          made even more vibrant when contrasted against the bright blue of the
          Southern Ocean.

          Montgomery Reef, WA <br />Visit at the wrong time and you won’t see
          it: Montgomery Reef appears and disappears with the tides. Time things
          perfectly – as the tide is going out – and you’ll see scores of mini
          waterfalls spring up and pour down the sides of the exposed coral
          shelves.
